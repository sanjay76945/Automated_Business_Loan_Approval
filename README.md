# Project Overview
This project aims to build an Automated Business Loan Approval System using PostgreSQL that leverages historical data to predict the likelihood of loan repayment. The system uses predefined SQL-based criteria to automatically approve or decline loan applications, streamlining the loan processing workflow for financial institutions. By employing PostgreSQL for data storage, querying, and decision-making logic, the project ensures efficient and scalable processing of loan data.
